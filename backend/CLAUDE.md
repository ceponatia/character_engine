# Backend Module - CLAUDE.md

## Module Purpose

This module provides the API server, request routing, and orchestration layer for the romantic chatbot system.

## Responsibilities

### API Management
- **RESTful Endpoints** - Character CRUD, session management, user authentication
- **WebSocket Server** - Real-time message delivery and presence tracking
- **Request Routing** - Route requests to appropriate service modules
- **Response Orchestration** - Coordinate multi-module responses

### System Integration
- **LLM Integration** - Interface with Ollama/local AI models via OpenAI-compatible API
- **Database Coordination** - Manage connections to PostgreSQL and vector databases
- **Character Engine Communication** - Route character state updates and personality validation
- **Session Management** - Handle session persistence and restoration

### Resource Management
- **Response Queue Management** - Sequential character response generation
- **GPU/CPU Allocation** - Resource management layer with graceful degradation
- **Rate Limiting** - Prevent system overload and manage concurrent users
- **Caching Strategy** - Cache frequent character states and conversation contexts

### Real-Time Coordination
- **Message Broadcasting** - WebSocket message distribution to clients
- **Typing Indicators** - Coordinate "character is typing" states
- **Presence Tracking** - Monitor user activity for ambient character actions
- **Interruption Logic** - Handle user interruptions of AI responses

## Technical Stack
- **Framework**: Node.js/Express with TypeScript
- **WebSocket**: Socket.io for real-time communication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM and pgvector extension
- **Vector DB**: PostgreSQL with pgvector for embeddings and similarity search
- **AI Integration**: Ollama v0.9.0 with local models + OpenAI embeddings

## Database Development Workflow

### For Schema Changes During Development:
```bash
# Use db:dev for development changes (faster, non-destructive when possible)
npm run db:dev

# Only use migrations for production-ready changes
npm run db:migrate

# Fresh start if database gets corrupted
npm run db:fresh
```

### Database Development Best Practices:
- PostgreSQL supports full DDL operations and migrations
- `db push` is still recommended for rapid development iteration
- Migrations provide version control and deployment consistency
- Use `db:dev` for development, migrations for production deployments

This module serves as the central nervous system coordinating all chatbot functionality.

## ðŸš€ System Refinement Roadmap (June 2025)

### ðŸš¨ Critical Issues - Week 1

#### Template Variable Processing Bug (High Priority)
**Issue**: `{{user}}` variables appearing in final responses, breaking immersion
**Impact**: Poor user experience, breaks roleplay immersion
**Solution**: Enhanced template processing pipeline in `character-engine.ts`
```typescript
private processMessageTemplates(message: string, sessionContext: any): string {
  return message
    .replace(/\{\{user\}\}/gi, sessionContext.userName || 'user')
    .replace(/\{\{character_name\}\}/gi, sessionContext.character.name)
    .replace(/\{\{location\}\}/gi, sessionContext.currentLocation || 'here')
    .replace(/\{\{time_of_day\}\}/gi, sessionContext.timeOfDay || 'now');
}
```

#### Romantic Roleplay Prompt Strategy
**Issue**: Generic prompts lack emotional depth for romantic scenarios
**Solution**: New `buildRomanticRoleplayPrompt()` strategy in `prompt-builder.ts`
- Emotional depth and atmospheric integration
- Relationship dynamics tracking
- Creative storytelling support
- Character-specific romantic context

### ðŸ“Š Data Management Optimization - Week 2-3

#### Session-Based Character Caching
**Current**: 3+ database queries per message (inefficient)
**Target**: 1 query per session with intelligent caching
**Implementation**: CharacterSessionManager class
```typescript
class CharacterSessionManager {
  private characterCache: Map<string, CharacterContext>;
  private conversationState: Map<string, ConversationMemory>;
}
```
**Expected Impact**: 50-70% reduction in response latency, 80% fewer database calls

#### Enhanced Data Flow Pipeline
**New Architecture**:
```
Frontend â†’ Session Manager â†’ Character Cache â†’ Smart Prompt Builder â†’ LLM â†’ Response Quality Pipeline â†’ Frontend
```

### ðŸŽ­ Response Quality Enhancement - Week 3-4

#### Post-Processing Pipeline
**Implementation**: ResponseQualityPipeline class
